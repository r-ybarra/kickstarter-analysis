## Recommendation
Based on the Kickstarter data we recieved I reccommend running a campaign between May and June with a goal of $2,000 or less. Of the specific plays we looked into, 4 were successfully kickstarted on that budget. "Be Prepared", "Checkpoint 22", "Cutting off Kate Bush", and "Jestia and Raedon" would all be suitable.
